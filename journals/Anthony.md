Challenges: Could not get authentication to work as well as displaying a payments page and processing. Uploading to GKE wasn't working as well. MySQL was deployed on docker and kong was being set up but ultimately couldn't push to GKE. UsersController was having many issues with authentication when testing to use authentication; however, the issues could not be resolved and the team had to revert the code.
